# Java-Section-2 Description
Slightly more advanced beginner Java projects. Run in Java Console.
These projects utilize String functions and also call methods

# Call Files
Car.java, Spinner.java, StringMixer.java, Student.java:
  These are files that contain the methods called by other files

StringMixer: Input is two strings which can be transformed using these methods
- StringMixer (if one string is input) cuts one string into two
- combine (combines both strings)
- add (adds a third string onto the two)
- disect (cuts part of the string according to number input)
- total (letter count)
- scramble (scrambles both strings into one)
There is a ToString() to return
