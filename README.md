# Java-Section-2 Description
Slightly more advanced beginner Java projects. Run in Java Console.
These projects utilize String functions and also call methods

# Call Files
Car.java, Spinner.java, StringMixer.java, Student.java:
  These are files that contain the methods called by other files

Car: Capable to put color, wheel size, and engine size using designed methods. Also has toString()

Spinner: methods that make up spinner game. Spinner generates a random number and if that number equals the same number spun before, then it will be tallyed in the val 'run'

StringMixer: Input is two strings which can be transformed using these methods
- StringMixer (if one string is input) cuts one string into two
- combine (combines both strings)
- add (adds a third string onto the two)
- disect (cuts part of the string according to number input)
- total (letter count)
- scramble (scrambles both strings into one)
There is a toString() to return

Student: creates students with different variables (first name, last name, age, ID) and has designed methods to set those variables



# Main Files
Run these in Java Console

HCS_2_1: code calls Student.java and creates/prints out different student objects.

HCS_2_2: tests methods in Spinner.java

HCS_2_3: code calls StringMixer.java

HCS_20220831: code calls Car.java and creates/prints different car objects

HCS_20220905: test code for Student.java callings

HCS_20220908 (two parts):
Dog class:
- bark method (simple text print) and sleep method (generates a val while dog is sleeping)
Calling part:
- calls different methods and prints it out in console

HCS_20220908PT2: utilizes .length and .substring methods

HCS_20220912: All mathematical and string based methods that are useful (some may be in AP test)
